# Benchmark-Bond-Portfolio-Strategies

Bond portfolio strategies are too many to enumerate. But there are benchmark bond strategies which are frequently introduced to textbook. Among them are bullet, barbell, ladder and buy-and-hold portfolios. For these bond portfolios, we are going to calculate monthly and cumulative returns. 

We assume the case of zero coupon bond portfolio for empirical exercises. Without target duration constraints, differences between zero coupon bond and coupon bearing bond are not large. It is well known that the coupon bond is the portfolio of zero coupon bonds.

    Bullet : maintain one bond with its maturity fixed
    Barbell : maintain two bonds with each maturities fixed and equal weights(1/2)
    Ladder : maintain all relevant bonds with each maturity fixed and equal weights(1/n)
    Buy and Hold : buy and hold one bond until its maturity and maintain this trade periodically
